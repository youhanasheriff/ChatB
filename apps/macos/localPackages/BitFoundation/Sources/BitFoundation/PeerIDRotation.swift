// periphery:ignore - intentionally unreferenced by production code. These are

// platforms agree on it; wiring them into the transport is the next step, not
// this one. Delete this annotation when the mesh starts using them.
/// Derivations for rotating peer IDs and pairwise recognition tags.
///
/// See `docs/PEER-ID-ROTATION.md` for the design, the threat model, and the
/// open questions. This type is the executable half of that document: it is
/// deliberately pure (no I/O, no clock of its own, no dependency on the BLE
/// stack) so both platforms can agree on the numbers before anyone wires it
/// into a transport.
///
/// Nothing here is used by the shipping mesh yet.
///
/// ## Why the derivations look like this
///
/// The rotating ID comes from **private** key material. Deriving it from the
/// public key would let anyone who has ever seen that key compute every past
/// and future ID, which is worse than not rotating because it would look like
/// protection. The same mistake is live in `CourierEnvelope.recipientTag`,
/// which is keyed on the recipient's *public* static key — and since that key
/// is broadcast in cleartext in every announce today, any observer in radio
/// range can compute a peer's courier tags for any day.
///
/// Recognition tags come from the X25519 shared secret between two static
/// keys, so exactly two parties can compute a given tag and an observer can
/// compute none of them.
