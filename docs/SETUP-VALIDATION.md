# Initial monorepo validation

The initial ChatB setup was checked locally on macOS with Xcode 27.0, Swift 6.4, and Rust 1.94.1.

Passed checks:

- Rust workspace formatting, Clippy with warnings denied, and a Release build. The crates contain scaffolding, not a working protocol port.
- 184 BitFoundation tests and 13 BitLogger tests. Courier vector lookup was updated for the relocated Apple package.
- 20 inherited Python tests, including checks of archived upstream workflow snapshots.
- SHA-256 verification of six imported interop fixtures against their unchanged upstream source copies.
- SHA-256 and file-set verification of seven vendored Arti artifacts against the preserved provenance document.
- Xcode project/plist syntax, scheme XML, local package paths, source-group paths, ChatB product naming, and retained Swift module identity.
- Swift package manifest evaluation, artifact-only clean recipe validation, CI YAML parsing, and Git whitespace checks.

The complete macOS Release build did not finish: Xcode remained fetching `swift-secp256k1`, and the local attempt was stopped. The full application test suite was not executed. CI includes a separate macOS Release build so unresolved build issues remain visible.

Windows and Linux app binaries have not been implemented, built, or tested. The Rust CI matrix checks the workspace scaffolding on all three operating systems; it does not establish Bluetooth interoperability or finished-client support.
